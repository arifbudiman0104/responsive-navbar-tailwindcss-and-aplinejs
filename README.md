# Responsive Navbar with Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js

This is a responsive navbar built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/). It is a simple navbar with a hamburger menu that opens and closes on click. It is fully responsive and works on mobile, tablet, and desktop. The icon is from [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/).

If you want to try it locally, you can clone this repository and use `live server` to preview it, dont use `show preview` button on VS Code because it will glitch.
